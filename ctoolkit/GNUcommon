# This is the common makefile that is used to build all components.
#
# The component makefile just defines the sources that comprise the component
# (the 'sources' variable), the library that should be built from them
# (the 'library' variable), and any include paths that are external to the
# component (the 'extra_includes' variable).
#
# All of the real work is then done via this common makefile, including building
# the component sources into a library, and cleaning the component.

# Use standard C99
#CFLAGS      += -std=iso9899:1999 -ggdb -pedantic-errors -Wall

# Use standard C99 with GNU extensions (Max OS X requires this) 
CFLAGS      += -std=gnu99 -ggdb -pedantic-errors -Wall
